# MySQL_Presentation
This is the git repository for my presentation about MySQL. You can find the presentation here as well as my Code example.

The Code Example requires a functioning MySQL-Server. Should you want to set up one by yourself, then you can do it with the community-version-installer which you can find here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ (Windows)
